    "**Rational numbers** are ones that can be **expressed in the fraction form** using two integers. An example of a rational number is \"1/2\". Another example of a rational number is \"8/9\". 7 is also a rational number (7/1) as is 0.3333333... (1/3). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Irrational Numbers\n",
    "*Irrational numbers* are ones that ***cannot*** be expressed in fraction form. Examples of irrational numbers are Pi (3.14159...) or the square root of 2 (1.414...). Surprisingly, there is a greater number of irrational numbers than rational numbers."
