    "# 1. INTRODUCTION TO DRAWING WITH TURTLE\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Turtle?\n",
    "\n",
    "Turtle is a software program that allows you to draw simple pictures by commanding a \"virtual turtle\" to move around a coordinate plane. The turtle relies on some simple commands such as forward, reverse, turn left, and turn right to create different shapes and patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use This File\n",
    "\n",
    "You will write turtle programs to draw different patterns. The file consists of different *Cells* that run snippets of code. To run a snippet of code you can press the Run button above or select the cell you want to run and push `Ctrl+Enter`. \n",

    "The turtle code works by instructing the turtle to either move forward or backward given amount, or turn left or right by a given number of degrees. In each cell we will use a new variable for each turtle. You can think of this as ***giving your turtle a name***. For example, we could start our code with:\n",
