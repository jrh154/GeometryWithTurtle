    "\n",
    "`gerald = newTurtle()`\n",
    "\n",
    "What is new here is that when you make the turtle you can use different settings, called `arguments`. `arguments` are used in programming when you do not know what will be the **input** of your function. As an analogy, in algebra we typically call `arguments` *variables*, such as *x*. In fact, you've already been using arguments! When you tell your turtle to move forward, you are passing an `argument` telling it how far to move! \n",
    "\n",
    "To make your turtle, you will need to use the `newTurtle()` function. The `newTurtle` function can take several `arguments` such as window width (`width`), background color (`bkg`) and the shape used for your turtle. The default settings are shown in the code you ran above! For instance, the default background color is White (`bkg = \"White`) and the default window width is 500 pixels (`width = 500`).\n",
    "\n",
    "To set these parameters, put the `arguments` you want to set in the parentheses () of the argument. For example, to set the background color to light green and the turtle shape to an arrow, you would create your turtle as follows:\n",
